                <p>I'm a guy with a keyboard. I try to avoid doing any work on this site if I can. Usually I avoid front-end work and design but I've had a website since 1995 so I have to keep the tradition going. There's also another guy who has my name and only appeared on the Internet recently, which is kind of freaking me out.</p>
                <p>I've written some programs you've never used or heard of. Sometimes I write little articles about hardware and a couple of times I even made some Youtube videos. Now I get notifications from Youtube about comments that I really don't want to read.</p>
